# Assignment - Advanced Regression
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

## General Information
- This project analyzes housing price data, preprocesses it, explores relationships between variables, builds predictive models, and evaluates their performance. It focuses on data quality, feature engineering, and model tuning to predict house prices accurately.
- The project involves Surprise Housing, a US-based company, venturing into the Australian housing market. They aim to use data analytics to predict property prices accurately, enabling them to make informed investment decisions.
- The business problem is to identify prospective properties in the Australian housing market that can be purchased at a price below their actual values and flipped for a profit.
- The dataset being used is a collection of information on houses sold in Australia. It includes various attributes such as the physical characteristics of the properties (e.g., lot size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms), as well as categorical variables describing aspects like zoning classification, neighborhood, and type of utilities available. Additionally, the dataset contains the sale price of each property, which serves as the dependent variable for the regression modeling task.


## Conclusions
- Optimal alpha values determine regularization strength in Ridge and Lasso regression.
- Ridge regression prioritizes variance reduction with higher alpha, while Lasso seeks balance with lower alpha.
- Significant variables like living area and overall quality strongly influence house prices.
- Leveraging regression insights aids Surprise Housing in maximizing returns and mitigating risks.
